Learning to program project of creating 100 web pages/ web apps

Matt here, I am a newbie attempting to learn to code. I am not the most creative person
so I am going to rip off Jennifer DeWalt's idea about learning to code through creating
a series of pages and applications. My goal is to create 100 pages/apps in a year or less.
